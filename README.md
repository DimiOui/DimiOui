### :bulb: Curiosity is My Driving Force
I believe that curiosity is the key to continuous growth and personal development. Throughout my life, I've been fortunate to embark on various adventures that have shaped my perspective.
I grew up in Arizona, surrounded by deserts, cacti, and American culture. The vivid memories of that period are etched in my mind. The scorching heat of Phoenix carries a distinct scent that is incomparable to the lush humidity of France, where I returned in 1996.
Inspired by movies like "Matrix" and "Ghost In the Shell," RPG video-games such as "Knights of the Old Republic" and "Mass Effect," and animes like "Serial Experiment Lain," I developed a deep passion for science fiction and the realms of imagination.
As I delved into passionate readings of novels from various countries, and embraced the open-mindedness instilled in me by my family, I also explored niche music genres, which I practice on my computer.

### :earth_asia: Embracing Diversity

Having spent three years in the United States during my youth, I had the opportunity to interact with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures. This experience broadened my horizons and instilled in me a deep appreciation for diversity and inclusivity. It also taught me the importance of empathy and effective communication, skills that are crucial in both programming and life. As a backpacker, I traveled through Asia for three months, immersing myself in different cultures and embracing the beauty of the unknown. These experiences ignited my passion for exploration and taught me the value of adaptability and open-mindedness.

### :video_game: Passion for Videogames

Apart from coding, I have a deep passion for videogames. I find them to be a remarkable form of art and storytelling that can transport us to different worlds and evoke emotions. Exploring the intersections of technology and gaming is an area that truly excites me.

### :hammer_and_wrench: From Welding to Programming

My journey has been anything but linear. I've worn multiple hats throughout my life, including working as a welder, boilermaker and industrial designer. These experiences provided me with a hands-on approach to problem-solving and honed my attention to detail. However, my curiosity eventually led me to explore the world of programming, where I discovered a new realm of creativity and endless possibilities.

# Projects I'm Proud of

I'm delighted to share some of my favorite projects that I've worked on:

### [FT_TRANSCENDANCE](https://github.com/misteriaud/ft_transcendence)

Ft_transcendance is a Docker-compose deployable webgame that features social-networking mechanisms such as friendships, direct-messages, and profile pictures. It includes a real-time multiplayer version of the classic game Pong and a chatroom with administration roles. The project also implements authentication using OAuth2 (through the 42school provider) and a 2FA-TOTP implementation. It is built on top of NestJS as the backend, PostgreSQL as the database, and ReactJS/Tailwind as the frontend.

Skills acquired:
- REST API concepts.
- Websockets.
- Multiplayer network gaming concepts (prediction, latency management)
- Interface between NestJS Object-oriented data-structure and PostgreSQL relational database via Prisma.
- Authentication and authorization standards (OAuth2, JWT, Password hashing, TOTP).

### [WEBSERV](https://github.com/ouafabulous/webserv_42)

WEBSERV is a fully configurable home-made web server implemented in C++. It follows the HTTP/1.1 RFC and employs an IO concurrent design pattern to serve as many successful requests as possible. The server can handle operations such as GET/POST/DELETE files, directory listing, and CGI execution.

Skills acquired:
- TCP connections via system calls (epoll, socket, accept, listen, send, recv, ...)
- Event-driven architecture and concurrent computing.
- RFC/Protocols understanding.
- Fault-tolerance design.

### [MINISHELL](https://github.com/DimiOui/minishell)

MINISHELL is an implementation from scratch in C of a bash interpreter. It utilizes various Unix system calls such as fork, pipe, signal, stat, and execve to provide a functional shell environment.

Skills acquired:
- Unix system calls (fork, pipe, signal, stat, execve, ...)
- Parallel execution.
