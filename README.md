### :bulb: Curiosity is My Driving Force
I believe that curiosity is the key to continuous growth and personal development. Throughout my life, I've been fortunate to embark on various adventures that have shaped my perspective.
I grew up in Arizona, surrounded by deserts, cacti, and American culture. The vivid memories of that period are etched in my mind. The scorching heat of Phoenix carries a distinct scent that is incomparable to the lush humidity of France, where I returned in 1996.
Inspired by movies like "Matrix" and "Ghost In the Shell," RPG video-games such as "Knights of the Old Republic" and "Mass Effect," and animes like "Serial Experiment Lain," I developed a deep passion for science-fiction and the realms of imagination.
As I delved into passionate readings of novels from various countries, and embraced the open-mindedness instilled in me by my family, I also explored niche music genres, which I practice today on my computer.

### :earth_asia: Embracing Diversity

As a backpacker, I traveled through Europe, Asia and the United-States, immersing myself in different cultures and embracing the beauty of the unknown. These experiences broadened my horizons and instilled in me a deep appreciation for diversity and inclusivity. It also taught me the importance of empathy and effective communication, skills that are crucial in both programming and life.

### :video_game: Passion for Videogames

Apart from coding, I have a deep passion for videogames, always eager to discover the latest releases in the industry (recently Dave The Diver and Diablo IV). I find them to be a remarkable form of art and storytelling that can transport us to different worlds and evoke emotions. Exploring the intersections of technology and gaming is an area that truly excites me.

### :hammer_and_wrench: From Welding to Programming

My journey has been anything but linear. I've worn multiple hats throughout my life, including working as a welder, boilermaker and industrial designer. These diverse experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me a remarkable ability to adapt to new challenges. Transitioning from the physical realm to the world of programming was a significant turning point in my life. It required a shift in perspective and the mastery of a new set of tools. However, my innate curiosity and adaptability served me well in this transition.

## Projects I'm Proud of

I'm delighted to share some of my favorite projects that I've worked on:

<details>
 <summary>FT_TRANSCENDANCE</summary>

 ### Project description
[Ft_transcendance](https://github.com/misteriaud/ft_transcendence) is a Docker-compose deployable webgame that features social-networking mechanisms such as friendships, direct-messages, and profile pictures. It includes a real-time multiplayer version of the classic game Pong and a chatroom with administration roles. The project also implements authentication using OAuth2 (through the 42school provider) and a 2FA-TOTP implementation. It is built on top of NestJS as the backend, PostgreSQL as the database, and ReactJS/Tailwind as the frontend.

### Skills acquired
- REST API concepts.
- Websockets.
- Multiplayer network gaming concepts (prediction, latency management, ...)
- Interface between NestJS Object-oriented data-structure and PostgreSQL relational database via Prisma.
- Authentication and authorization standards (OAuth2, JWT, Password hashing, TOTP).
